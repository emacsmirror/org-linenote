* What is this package?

Sometimes, we need 'line-by-line' notes to analyze the code. I made this package to study Linux kernel. This package manages the notes by using relative path and filename. Every notes are stored in =.linenote= directory in the project root directory.

* Usage

- ~org-linenote-mode~: to enable linenote's highlight on the current buffer.
- ~org-linenote-browse~: to browse notes for the current buffer.
