* org-linenote

An Emacs note package inspired by Visual Studio Code's Linenote (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tkrkt.linenote).

** What is this package?

=org-linenote= has several key features:

- Creating a note per line
- Saving notes by preserving the directory structure
- Compatibility with VS Code Linenote extension
- No org properties required
- Based on a Git repository

=org-linenote= is useful when you need a detailed note on a specific line of code or document, unlike other note-taking packages that create a note per file. Additionally, the package does not require Org properties but only utilizes the line number from the filename.

Also, the package provides compatibility with the VS Code Linenote extension. If you manage the notes within the markdown (.md) format, the same notes can also be utilized in Visual Studio Code.

These features make =org-linenote= useful when you need 'line-by-line' notes to analyze the code and share notes with others. I use this package for analyzing Linux kernel and sharing insights with people (most of them are vscode users).

* Installation

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(require 'org-linenote)
#+END_SRC

* Usage

[[https://github.com/seokbeomKim/org-linenote/blob/image/example.gif]]

The package provides interactive functions as follows:

- ~org-linenote-mode~: to enable Linenote's highlight on the current buffer.
- ~org-linenote-browse~: to browse notes for the current buffer.
- ~org-linenote-add-annotate~: to add a note for the current line.
- ~org-linenote-edit-annotate~: an alias for ~org-linenote-add-annotate~. Edit the note corresponding to the current line.
- ~org-linenote-remove-annotate~: to remove the note corresponding to the current line.
- ~org-linenote-move-forward~: to move to the next note from the current line.
- ~org-linenote-move-backward~: to move to the previous note from the current line.
- ~org-linenote-find-root-dir~: to find the root directory of the project.
- ~org-linenote-find-note-dir~: to find the note directory of the current buffer.
- ~org-linenote-auto-open~: to enable the note-following feature to view notes of the currently focused line.

** Single-line and multi-line notes

This package manages the notes by using relative paths and line numbers. Every note is stored in the =.linenote= directory in the project root directory with the relative path and the line number.

For example, when we add a note on ~init/main.c:131~, then it creates the note in ~.linenote/init/main.c#L131.org~ (or ~.md~ file based on the configuration). You can also create a multi-line note by selecting multiple lines in the code or document. In this case, the note is created in ~.linenote/init/main.c#L131-133.org~, for example.

** Integrating org-linenote and VS Code's Linenote

=org-linenote= utilizes the directory ~$PROJECT/.linenote~, but VS Code Linenote uses ~$PROJECT/.vscode/linenote~.

Notes must be in markdown format to be displayed correctly in VS Code. =org-linenote= can deal with both org and markdown format. But, VS Code Linenote can only deal with markdown format. So, I recommend using the markdown format for compatibility with vscode-linenote if you use vscode as well.

If you want to create notes with a different extension, you can set ~org-linenote--default-extension~ to other values. This only affects the extension of new notes to create and does not filter existing notes.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-linenote--default-extension ".md")
#+end_src

Create a symbolic link (org-linenote directory to VS Code Linenote directory)

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ ln -sv $PROJECT/.linenote $PROJECT/.vscode/linenote
#+END_SRC
